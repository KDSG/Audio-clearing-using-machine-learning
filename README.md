# Audio-clearing-using-machine-learning
Our idea was to create an application using Neural Network that could be trained using data sets for solving a certain problem. We used Octave as a platform to study all the characters of sound and all its related parameters. First, we gave noise and audio(noise+vocals) as an input unit and retrieve pure vocals as output after around 50 iterations.
- All code is written in Octave.
- Back Propagation Algorithm is used.
